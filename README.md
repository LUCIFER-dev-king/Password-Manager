# E Pass

E Pass is a password manager inspired by Last Pass.

## Project Overview

E Pass is a password manger inspired by Last Pass. MERN stack is used to build this project. This project also consists of a chrome extension where it tracks current tab and gives the credentials if exists. Also we generate password with symbols and numbers in that extension.
In E Pass we can save credentials like email, password, important notes, bank account information. Also we can search through all password list.

- AES256 algorithm is used for encryption and decrytpion of credentials.
- Deboucing is implemented with help of lodash.deboucing for search functions.
- To prevent XSS attacks two separate token are used.
